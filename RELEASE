# Prepare working tree for release

1. Add an entry to the `HISTORY` file with the version name, release date and
   what's new in the new version.
2. Update copyright dates if needed:
    - `COPYRIGHT` file;
    - `_COPYRIGHT` exported constant in the main module.
3. Update version in `_VERSION` exported constant in the main module.
4. Regenerate exports list (performed by `./make.sh`)
5. Generate `scm-1` rockspec (performed by `./make.sh`)
6. Generate `VERSION-1` rockspec, where VERSION is the version to be released.
   Example:
   ```
   lua etc/rockspec/generate.lua 1.1.0-1 v1.1.0 > rockspec/lua-nucleo-1.1.0-1.rockspec
   ````
7. Regenerate API docs: `./make-doc.sh`
8. Make sure that all the changes is in the working tree.
9. Tag the working tree head with the version name, e.g. `v1.1.0`.
10. Push tag to origin.
