# Prepare working tree for release

1. Add an entry to the `HISTORY` file with the version name, release date and
   what's new in the new version.
2. Update copyright dates if needed:
    - `COPYRIGHT` file;
    - `_COPYRIGHT` exported constant in the main module.
3. Update version in `_VERSION` exported constant in the main module.
4. Regenerate tests list (performed by `./make.sh`)
5. Regenerate exports list (performed by `./make.sh`)
6. Generate `scm-1` rockspec (performed by `./make.sh`)
7. Generate `VERSION-1` rockspec, where VERSION is the version to be released.
   Example:
   ```
   lua etc/rockspec/generate.lua 1.1.0-1 v1.1.0 > rockspec/lua-nucleo-1.1.0-1.rockspec
   ````
8. Regenerate API docs: `./make-doc.sh`
9. Make sure that all the changes is in the working tree.
10. Last check that all tests are passed OK in latest Lua 5.1, Lua 5.2, Lua 5.3
    Lua 5.4
10. Tag the working tree head with the version name, e.g. `v1.1.0`.
11. Push tag to origin.
